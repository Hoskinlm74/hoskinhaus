# Rooted Stewardship Website

This repository hosts the public website for our tree service.

Our work is grounded in long-term thinking, careful stewardship, and respect for living systems — both in nature and in the tools we use to serve our community.

## Philosophy

We believe:

- Strong systems grow slowly.
- Local responsibility outlasts centralized convenience.
- Stewardship applies to land, tools, and culture.
- Technology should serve people, not profile them.

This website is intentionally simple, durable, and dependency-light.

## Hosting

The site is hosted using **Cloudflare Pages** with static HTML.

No build step.  
No tracking scripts.  
No unnecessary dependencies.

## Maintenance Principles

When editing this site:

- Prefer clarity over cleverness.

- Prefer human readability over algorithmic optimization.

## Quiet Reminder

Just as trees outlive us,  
the choices we encode into our systems often outlive us too.

Build accordingly.
